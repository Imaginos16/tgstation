  - rscadd: "Cone of Cold, for Void heretics. Shoots out a freezing chill in a cone which deal damage and freezes."
  - rscadd: "Flesh Surgery for Flesh heretics. A touch spell which can either heal minions or be used on mobs to extract organs without surgery."

  - balance: "Heretic ghouls now take reduced stamina damage, depending on how small their health pool is."
  - balance: "Using Jaunts will conceal your runechat for their duration."
  - balance: "Spells which require emoting (Mime spells) require your hands not be blocked to use."
